        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>Dr. Teeniepaws was born at the age of six without a face in 1348. Despite lacking a face, he managed to climb the social ladders of his country club with his sick skateboarding skills and 30 PHDs. For a span of time in the 1990s he changed his name to Peter Petegrew and tried out being a tratorus jerk/small child's pet. This however didn't work out and he was homeless till the late 2030s. Lately he has been put his 50 PHDs to use by constructing a time machine and kissing lots of girls.</p>
